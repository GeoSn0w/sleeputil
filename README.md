# sleeputil
A tiny C++ wrapper around pmset to prevent or enable sleeping with the lid closed on MacBooks
I made it because caffeinate refuses to work on macOS Sierra and newer and any other solution I tried refuses to work especially with the lid closed. This works and it is pretty much just a wrapper around pmset. Do `man pmset` to read more about it. It's quite cool.

### BIG ASS WARNING!
Closing your lid may block the air vents! DO NOT use this if you plan to have any sort of resources demanding tasks running on your MacBook as it may not cool properly!!! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!

I am not responsible for any damages that may occur by using this program! Use at your own risk!
